## Get a list of blazars

Went to wikipedia, checked the references at the end and found a
"Blazar monitorin list", which sounds pretty reliable.
Took it from the webpage, cleaned it to have a list of names their positions.

The _list_ -- which we will call the _Mojave list of blazars_ if necessary to
be specific in the future -- is now in the (CSV) file `blazarlist.csv`.
The list has 630 objects.

> TODO: plot the objects RA,Dec position.
